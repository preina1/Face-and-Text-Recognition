# Face-and-Text-Recognition
This task was completed as a final project for the Python 3 Programming certificate. The goal was to iterate through a series of zip files containing pictures of newspapers articles and use face and text recognition to complete a task. 

The assigned task was to develop code using Python to search for a keyword in each newspaper article stored as an image in the list of files and return a contact sheet of all the faces found in that newspaper article using face recognition. Two target keywords were provided for this task: “Christopher” and “Mark”. Therefore, the output of this task are two contact sheets each displaying the faces of each newspaper article where these keywords were found. The contact sheet also displays the file names where the keywords were found, and if there were no faces found when using the keywords in a particular file, a message stating this is displayed in replacement of the faces.

The Python libraries Pillow, pytesseract, OpenCV, NumPy, and zipfile were used for this project. This repository includes the present README file and the Jupyter Notebook with the Python code and results for this project.
